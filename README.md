# Arduino-Micro-with-ESP12E
Project Description:
Our project is Arduino Atmega-32u4 based Arduino micro combined with ESP-12E. It communicates with the ESP-12E chip via Arduino tx rx.The users can use the tx-rx pins with atmega -32u4 chip for another project by using a switch on the card if they want.Since ESP-12E operates with 3.3V logic level, one 5v to 3v3 logic converter circuit is used for rx and rx pins.There are 3 buttons on the board: esp-flash, esp-reset and Arduino reset.Since the 3v3 output of Arduino micro can not meet the power requirement of ESP12-E, 3v3Ä°N input has been added for external supply.Since there are multiple components and net ports on the PCB, the design of the card is arranged in 4 layers.Since some components are not included in the Diptrace program, external libraries have been used.Also, since some components do not have patterns, the datasheets of the components are examined and drawn in the pattern editor.
